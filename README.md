# nodemapannotate

The goal is to create a map that can be drawn on (or annotated) and those changes saved. Then at a later date the annotations can be edited/removed/updated. 

Often people take a screenshot of a map, then use a drawing application to mark points of interest on it. That screenshow with draws on it can then be distributed as needed. 
However, if those points of interest change location then the whole thing needs to be redone from scratch as the annotations are part of the image and cannot be edited.

A use-case is tracking the locations of kiwis and good points to scan to get their signals. 
The kiwi are generally territorial and stay in a given location but can move around before nesting, or a kiwi that has not yet paired up can be constantly on the move.
This can mean that a lot of maps with kiwi locations need to be created as the kiwi move so that everyone is aware of their locations. 
Being able to move and edit the annotations hopefully reduces the work involved in keeping everyone up-to-date with their last known locations.

It would be great if you didn't put cuss words on it.
